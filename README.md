The name of this assignment is Assignment_04_New_One and this assignment is related to exceptions, logging and Debugging.

## Program Name

According to tools and techniques, I will use proper formatting, commenting, try/except blocks, clear and easy to read code and also use variables for all the values to make the record easier to follow.

## Code Modification

I updated the pixell_transaction_report.py file where I added try/except block to catch an error. The purpose is to read the error in friendly way.
